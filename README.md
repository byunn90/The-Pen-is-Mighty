# ðŸ“’ Note-Taker

## Description

simple note-taking application using Express.js. It allows clients to create and save notes by sending a POST request to /api/notes, and delete notes by sending a DELETE request to /api/notes/:id, where :id is the ID of the note to be deleted. Clients can also retrieve a list of all notes by sending a GET request to /api/notes.

The implementation uses a db.json file to store the notes. When a client creates a new note, the note is added to the db.json file with a unique ID generated using the uuidv4 library. When a client deletes a note, the note with the corresponding ID is removed from the db.json file. When a client retrieves a list of notes, the notes are read from the db.json file and returned in JSON format.

Overall, this implementation provides a simple way for clients to manage notes through basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
